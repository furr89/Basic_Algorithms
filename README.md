Algorithm projects with 7 tasks

Square Root of an Integer: The goal was to find the square root of an int without using any built in functions with a time complexity of O(log n).

Search in a Rotated Sorted Array: The task here is to find the index of a given number from an array that has been rotated: [4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3], the expected time complexity is O(Log n)

Rearrange Array Digits: The goal here is to sort an array without using any built in sorting function and return two rearranged numbers.

Dutch National Flag: With an array consisting of only 0, 1, 2, the challenge was to sort the array in a single pass with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.

Autocomplete With Tries: Using a trie data structure, the task was to implement an autocomplete feature.

Unsorted Integer Array: The task here is to find the lowest and highest number in an array without using inbuilt functions. The expected time complexity is O(n) with a single pass. 

Request Routing using a Trie: The objective is to implement an HTTP router, given an input of a path, it would return its handler.
